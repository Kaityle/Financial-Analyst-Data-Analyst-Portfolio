## About
Hi, I'm Kaity! I hold a dual academic background in Information Decision Science and Corporate Finance, earning Bachelor of Science degrees in both fields. Through my studies, I’ve built a strong foundation in finance and developed a passion for applying technical and analytical skills to extract meaningful business insights.

I’m driven by the challenge of translating data into strategy—using tools like SQL, Python, and Excel to dive deep into databases, uncover trends, and understand what the numbers are really saying. My internship experience has given me valuable real-world exposure, helping me understand how to create tangible value for businesses through data-driven decision-making.

I’m excited to bring my technical expertise, curiosity, and analytical mindset to an entry-level role in finance.

**Documentation Report:** [Target Financial Modeling Report](https://github.com/Kaityle/Financial-Analyst-Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/8d1a18780727d61f669f61a8e4b21473eb5c03b9/Target's%20Financial%20Modeling.pdf) 

- **Goal:**  Develop a comprehensive financial model with scenario-based forecasting to assess how tariff policies may affect Target Corporation’s financial performance, including analysis of the relationship between tariffs and overall company results.

- **Description:** This project evaluated the impact of tariff policies on Target Corporation by building a detailed financial model using historical data from FY2023A to FY2025A, covering all core financial statements, a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation, and a 5-year forecast. Scenario-based forecasting simulated different tariff outcomes. Simple and multiple regression analyses examined relationships between tariffs, inflation, trade policy, and gross profit. An interactive Tableau dashboard was created to visualize performance trends and scenario comparisons.

- **Skill:** Financial Modeling, Forecasting, Scenario Analysis, DCF Valuation, Regression Analysis, Data Visualization, Tableau Dashboard. 

- **Technical tools:** Excel, Tableau

- **Result:** Delivered detailed financial models and DCF analysis showing Target may face short-term tariff impacts but will recover quickly. The undervalued DCF suggests a buy opportunity. Regression results and a Tableau dashboard highlighted key trends.
