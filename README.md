## About
Hi, I'm Kaity! I hold a dual academic background in Information Decision Science and Corporate Finance, earning Bachelor of Science degrees in both fields. Through my studies, I’ve built a strong foundation in finance and developed a passion for applying technical and analytical skills to extract meaningful business insights.

I’m driven by the challenge of translating data into strategy—using tools like SQL, Python, and Excel to dive deep into databases, uncover trends, and understand what the numbers are really saying. My internship experience has given me valuable real-world exposure, helping me understand how to create tangible value for businesses through data-driven decision-making.

I’m excited to bring my technical expertise, curiosity, and analytical mindset to an entry-level role in finance.

An interactive Tableau dashboard was created to visualize performance trends and scenario comparisons.
