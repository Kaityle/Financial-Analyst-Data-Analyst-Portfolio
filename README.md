# Kaity Le | Financial Analyst | Business Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Kaity! I hold a dual academic background in Information Decision Science and Corporate Finance, earning Bachelor of Science degrees in both fields. Through my studies, I’ve built a strong foundation in finance and developed a passion for applying technical and analytical skills to extract meaningful business insights.

I’m driven by the challenge of translating data into strategy—using tools like SQL, Python, and Excel to dive deep into databases, uncover trends, and understand what the numbers are really saying. My internship experience has given me valuable real-world exposure, helping me understand how to create tangible value for businesses through data-driven decision-making.

I’m excited to bring my technical expertise, curiosity, and analytical mindset to an entry-level role in finance.

**Documentation Report:** [Target Financial Modeling Report](https://github.com/Kaityle/Financial-Analyst-Data-Analyst-Portfolio/blob/8d1a18780727d61f669f61a8e4b21473eb5c03b9/Target's%20Financial%20Modeling.pdf) 

- **Goal:** To develop a comprehensive financial model that includes scenario-based forecasting to evaluate how tariff policies may impact the performance of Target Corporation. The analysis also explores the relationship between tariff policies and the company's overall financial performance.

- **Description:** This project aimed to evaluate how tariff policies could impact Target Corporation’s financial performance. I developed a comprehensive financial model using historical data through FY2023A-FY2025A, including all core financial statements and a 5-year forward-looking forecast. The model applied scenario-based forecasting to reflect different tariff policy outcomes. Additionally, I conducted both simple and multiple regression analyses to explore the relationship between tariffs, inflation, trade policy, and gross profit. An interactive Tableau dashboard was created to visualize performance trends and scenario comparisons.

- **Skill:** Financial Modeling, Forecasting, Scenario Analysis, DCF Valuation, Regression Analysis, Data Visualization, Tableau Dashboard. 

- **Technical tools:** Excel, Tableau

- **Result:** Built comprehensive financial models with 8 statements and DCF. Used forecast data for simple and multiple regressions to analyze insights. Created a Tableau dashboard to visualize key trends.
